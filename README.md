# dayplanner-jquery
# Your Project Title

## Description 

for this project i had to use jquery to make a day planner. By using jquery and the .moment function i was able to get the current day that the user accesses the website. I also used jquery to link to css files to be able to create a dyndayic page that looks pretty. By using javascript i was also able to save styles to local storage on the user browers...like in the previous gdaye activity. I also created a text input box using jquery that will be present whether or not the user refreshes the screen. 



## Installation

just a basic web-brower is all the user will need.

## Usage 

the user will load up the page be be shown the current month day and year. they will then be presented with standard business hours that will be color coded. the user will be able to save things to the "description" div by pressing the big blue button. after pressing the button the information will be saved to the local storage that will then remain after a refresh.

## Credits

I would like to thank Bryan Swarthout and Wilson Lday for providing the base css and Javascript...I also used MDN to learn about the usage of grave accents to be able to concat multiple parts into a string. I also had to read up the "sibling" usage.
